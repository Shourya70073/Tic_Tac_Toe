# Tictactoe

Tic Tac Toe is Hello world of the software development, even Bill gates wrote his first computer program an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer.

This is an Tic Tac Toe game developed using flutter, I have used the concept of Soft UI also known as Neumorphism to design this app, this is the landing page of our app, The reset button at the bottom intializes the game to the intial state at any point of the game.
